NEU-RTES is a laboratory in the Institute of Computer Software and Theory at Northeastern University, China. We conduct research in the areas of real-time embedded systems. Topics of interest are:

> - Real-time scheduling on multiprocessor/multi-core architectures
> - Real-time reconfigurable computing
> - Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis
> - Formal methods in real-time embedded system analysis

The NEU-RTES laboratory combines the above expertise areas in projects on real-time embedded system design in manufacturing industry. The laboratory also provides courses on real-time embedded systems to postgraduate students at Northeastern University.
